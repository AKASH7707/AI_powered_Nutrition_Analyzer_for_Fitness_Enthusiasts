# AI_powered_Nutrition_Analyzer_for_Fitness_Enthusiasts

### 1.1 Project Overview:
The main aim of the project is to building a model which is used for
classifying the fruit depends on the different characteristics like color, shape,
texture etc. Here the user can capture the images of different fruits and the image
will be sent to the trained model. The model analyses the image and detect
nutrition based on the fruits like(Sugar, Fiber, Protein, Calories, etc...).
### 1.2 Purpose:
Food is essential for human life and has been the concern of many health
conventions. Nowadays new dietary assessment and nutrition analysis tools
enables more opportunities to help people understand their daily eating habits,
exploring nutrition patterns and maintain a healthy diet. Nutritional analysis is the
process of determining the nutritional content of food. It is a vital part of analytical
chemical composition, processing, quality control and contamination of food. So
there is a need for model to find the nutrition content present in food.
